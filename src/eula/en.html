Accepting this agreement, I allow @kozalo, his bots and other applications in the ecosystem to save and store my personal data such as:
➖ name (full name got from Telegram or inputted manually);
➖ language and approximate location (to provide more accurate results).
The list of collected data may be changed in the future. I agree to accept the changes without a need to perform additional actions.

The data is stored inside the database of <b>user-service</b> which is an open sourced project located at GitHub. You may always check the data, we collect, here: https://github.com/Kozalo-Blog/user-service/blob/main/migrations/
