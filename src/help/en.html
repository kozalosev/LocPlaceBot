I can help you to attach a location based on its coordinates or find a place by its textual address.

Just send me either the coordinates as is: <code>38.8976804, -77.0391101</code>,
or the address: <code>1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20500, United States</code>,
or a textual description: <code>White House Washington DC</code>.

The same is available via inline queries: <code>@{{bot_name}} Statue of Liberty</code>

These commands are supported:
/help — print a help message.
/loc — use this command to search for a place in a group chat since the bot has no access to usual messages.
<code>/setlang ru</code> — change the language.
/setloc — clarify your location to make search results more relevant.
