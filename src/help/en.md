I can help you to attach a location based on its coordinates or find a place by its textual address\.

Just send me either the coordinates as is: `38.8976804, -77.0391101`,
or the address: `1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20500, United States`,
or a textual description: `White House Washington DC`\.

The same is available in inline queries: `@{{bot_name}} Statue of Liberty`

These commands are supported:
/help — print a help message
/loc — use this command to search for a place in a group chat since the bot has no access to usual messages
